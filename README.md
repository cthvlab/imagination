 Laravel 8 Test App
 
 1. Make a page for creating a post (post - entity). The post must contain the following information - id, title, description (text), creation date, picture (which can be uploaded to the server), and tags that can be selected from the list (already existing) or create new ones.
Hint - tags have a many-to-many relationship with posts.
2. You need to make a page that displays the list of posts (post - entity). In this list, each line should contain the following roles - id, title, creation date and a button for editing and deleting a post.
3. When editing a post, you can also change any information about the post, except for the id. Tags can be added, removed or new ones created.
4. Using a database (any relational, except SQLite), a framework of your choice (Symfony, Laravel, Yii) and php are required.
